			How We Spent Two Days Making Perl Faster
		</h1>
  	</header>

	<p class="post__lede">This is a story about a significant new optimization to the Perl
	interpreter. It is a story about battling code complexity. And it is a
	story about wanting to have our cake and eat it too.</p>

	<p>A recent Booking.com hackathon provided us the opportunity to
	investigate speeding up integer allocation in the Perl interpreter. If
	successful, this could optimize nearly every program we run. We
	discovered that a naive implementation <em>could</em> work, but would make the
	code a lot more difficult to maintain. Our path lead us to attempt to
	leverage the C preprocessor to improve code clarity while opening doors
	to real gains in program execution speed.</p>

	<h2>First, some background</h2>
	<p>As described in <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlguts.html" title="perlguts">perlguts</a> and <a href="http://cpansearch.Perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.49/index.html" title="PerlGuts Illustrated">PerlGuts Illustrated</a>, representations of variables in Perl are usually composed of two parts: a <em>head</em> struct and (optionally) a <em>body</em> struct.
	The <em>head</em> contains the essential &ldquo;internal book-keeping&rdquo;
	common to all variables (regardless of type) including a pointer to the
	(optional) <em>body</em> struct. Below is an image of the layout of fields in a
	<em>head</em> struct as depicted in <em>PerlGuts Illustrated</em>:</p>
	<p><center><img
	  src="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.49/svhead.png"
	  alt="SV Head (PerlGuts Illustrated)"></center></p>
	
	<p>The <em>body</em> struct can be quite different, depending upon the type of the
	variable. The most simple type of variable is the <code>SvNULL</code>, which
	represents <code>undef</code> and does not need a body struct at all.</p>

	<p>A string (called <code>PV</code> for &ldquo;pointer value&rdquo;) has a body type of <code>XPV</code>:</p>

	<p><center><img
	  src="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.49/svpv-14.png"
	  alt="SvPV (PerlGuts Illustrated)"></center></p>
	
	<p>But the body struct of a <code>PV</code> is different to a body struct of a <code>PVNV</code>.
	A <code>PVNV</code> can hold a floating point number and a string representation of
that same value:</p>
<p><center><img
  src="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.49/svpvnv-14.png"
  alt="SvPVNV (PerlGuts Illustrated)"></center></p>
<p>One benefit of this type of design is that all references to the value
point to the memory location of the <em>head</em>. As such, Perl is free to
change which memory is being used to represent a value by changing the
<em>body</em> struct, without having to update any pointer except the pointer
contained within the <em>head</em>.</p>
<h2>Changing types</h2>
<p>Naturally, Perl has an internal function to convert between types of
variable. This function is <code>sv_upgrade</code> (&ldquo;scalar value
upgrade&rdquo;). In essence, whenever we have a variable of some type in
Perl (for example, a simple integer) and we need to access it as a
different type (for example, a string), the <code>sv_upgrade</code> will convert
the type of the variable (for example, into a type that contains both
integer and string representations of a value). This change may involve
replacing the body struct with a larger struct.</p>
<p>To see how <code>sv_upgrade</code> is implemented, we can look at the
<code>Perl_sv_upgrade</code> function in <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/2a4873c400916c0a8c610de00a75facc925c0b6a:/sv.c#l1203" title="sv.c Perl_sv_upgrade"><code>sv.c</code></a>. We see that this function encapsulates a lot
of complexity. There are many comments, which describe subtle corner
cases. Since it can take a scalar value of essentially any type and
convert it to something capable of representing any other type, perhaps
it&rsquo;s unsurprising that there&rsquo;s a lot of code here.</p>
<p>Without going line-by-line, an overview of how this function is
implemented may be useful. First, there is a <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/2a4873c400916c0a8c610de00a75facc925c0b6a:/sv.c#l1272" title="sv.c Perl_sv_upgrade first switch"><code>switch</code></a> based on the current type of
variable, to determine what it needs for the new type. Shortly
thereafter, there is a <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/2a4873c400916c0a8c610de00a75facc925c0b6a:/sv.c#l1330" title="sv.c Perl_sv_upgrade second switch">second <code>switch</code></a> based on the new type. Inside of
the second <code>switch</code> block, there are numerous <code>if</code> blocks for doing
different things depending on the old type. Finally, after the new body
struct has been set up, and the head struct contains all the correct
flags, the memory used by the old body is freed.</p>
<p>Still with me? Good.</p>
<h2>A naive optimization</h2>
<p>The <code>sv_upgrade</code> function is called from a number of places. Not only is
it called in places such as printing integers as strings, but it&rsquo;s
also called when assigning an integer value to a previously cleared
variable.</p>
<p>A previously cleared variable is always an <code>undef</code> with no body struct.
The reason <code>sv_upgrade</code> is called is to allow the correct setup for the
body to occur. This was a very sensible design decision, as it
centralizes a lot of &ldquo;internal book-keeping&rdquo; behavior,
rather than duplicating it. The cost of this centralization is
performance: some generic (and in this case superfluous) code is
executed. For example, when creating a new integer, <code>sv_upgrade</code> will
run an unnecessary check for a conversion of a larger type to a smaller
type.</p>
<p>Integer assignment to a cleared variable occurs so frequently that one
would imagine it might be worth duplicating the required complexity to
achieve the performance improvement. Thus we decided to evaluate that
trade-off for integer allocation. After a review of the nearly 300 lines
of <code>sv_upgrade</code> internals, we saw that we could remove the call entirely
if we could &ldquo;hoist out&rdquo; just the essential <strong>two lines</strong> of
code! However, there is a very good reason this had not been done
before. Let's look at the two lines.</p>
<p>The first line (since we know the new type) is easy:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>SvFLAGS(sv) |= new_type;
</pre></div>


<p>But the other line is quite complex:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>SvANY(sv) = (XPVIV*)((char*)&amp;(sv-&gt;sv_u.svu_iv) - STRUCT_OFFSET(XPVIV, xiv_iv));
</pre></div>


<p>If your head is swimming after looking at that last line of code,
don&rsquo;t worry: you&rsquo;re in good company. Granted, this is
described in <em>Illustrated perlguts</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 5.10 for a raw IV (without PV) the IVX slot is in the HEAD,
there is no xpviv struct ("body") allocated. The SvIVX macro abuses
SvANY pointer arithmethic <!-- [sic] --> to point to a compile-time
calculated negative offset from HEAD-1 to sv_u.svu_iv, so that PVIV
and IV can use the same SvIVX macro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, even once I thought I maybe understood what that complex line of
code supposedly did, I made <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/SMUELLER">Steffen</a> patiently sit for more than 15
minutes as I convinced myself with paper and pencil that it actually did
what he had described. After that, the drawing from Illustrated Perl
Guts made more sense to me:</p>
<p><center><img
  src="http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/RURBAN/illguts-0.49/sviv-14.png"
  alt="Bodyless SVIV (PerlGuts Illustrated)"></center></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I finally understood that <em>this</em> complexity exists in
order to avoid executing an <code>if</code> statement that would otherwise be
called every time the value is retrieved!</p>
<p>Thus, the previous design trade-offs seemed like the right ones. Yes,
we could make Perl faster, but at the cost of leaking a lot of
complexity into another part of the code. That complexity would make any
additional development much more difficult in any future work.</p>
<h2>Having our cake and eating it too</h2>
<!-- Could we contain that hairy bit of code in a hairnet? -->

<!-- If we simply created a function, we would risk adding some small
overhead that comes with calling a function. -->

<!-- A bigger
discussion about linkers and whether or not this will be optimized away
by a compiler. -->

<p>We wanted to encapsulate that very complex bit of code, but without any
added runtime performance cost. Since this is C, we looked at using the
preprocessor to push the complexity behind a macro, in much the same way
that with other languages we might move some hairy lines of code behind
a well named function or method:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>#define SET_SVANY_FOR_BODYLESS_IV(sv) \
    SvANY(sv) = (XPVIV*)((char*)&amp;(sv-&gt;sv_u.svu_iv) - STRUCT_OFFSET(XPVIV, xiv_iv))
</pre></div>


<p>And, of course, the advantage of using a macro (rather than a function)
is that the cost is paid entirely at compile time, and thus there is
zero additional runtime performance lost.</p>
<p>By <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/patch/dc6369efc01b79eb657ea176c81cab927b54a2d1" title="Refactor bodyless-IV/NV hacks into define">introducing the macro</a>, the readability of the
code would be improved in several places.</p>
<p>So, how did this change our situation? With the macro, the two lines we
wanted to &ldquo;hoist out&rdquo; looked a lot less complex. All we
would need would be a <a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/patch/de06ff5a50f29eaee3e72394fa1c2417689cac47" title="Speed up assigning an IV to a previously cleared SV">patch</a> which replaces
this one computationally heavy function call:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>sv_upgrade(dstr, SVt_IV);
</pre></div>


<p>with just these two lines:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>SET_SVANY_FOR_BODYLESS_IV(dstr);
SvFLAGS(dstr) |= SVt_IV;
</pre></div>


<p>By factoring the complexity differently, we opened the doors to a
different set of performance/complexity cost trade-offs. We would leak
only a small amount of complexity relative to the gain in performance.
But is it worth it? With these changes, the cost would be low, but what
would the actual benefit be?</p>
<h2>Measuring the gain</h2>
<p>The micro-benchmark we used is very heavy on exercising one particular
code path, however it is a common code path.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  <span class="nv">$</span> <span class="nv">dumbbench</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i50</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">pin</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">frequency</span> <span class="o">--</span> <span class="o">\</span>
    <span class="o">./</span><span class="n">perl</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Ilib</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">\</span>
    <span class="s">&#39;for my $x (1..1000){my @a = (1..2000);}&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here are the results of the micro-benchmark before the optimization:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  Rounded run time per iteration: 2.4311e-01 +/- 1.4e-04
</pre></div>


<p>And here are the results after the optimization:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>  Rounded run time per iteration: 1.99354e-01 +/- 5.5e-05
</pre></div>


<p>That&rsquo;s 18% faster.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, this hackathon project was a success.</p>
<p>With these measurements, we demonstrated that the optimization was
worthwhile. The complexity cost is pretty close to zero: in some places
the Perl core is <em>slightly</em> more complex, but the internals of
<code>sv_upgrade</code> are certainly more clear.<!-- The values of the earlier
design decisions were respected (containing complexity) and new
performance wins have been achieved.--> Additionally, we found there
were other similar potential optimizations that could leverage the same
technique. In the end, five related patches were pushed to Perl:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/dc6369efc01b79eb657ea176c81cab927b54a2d1">Refactor bodyless-IV/NV hacks into define</a></li>

</ul>
<p>When Perl 5.22 ships, in part because of this work, many real-world
programs will be faster.</p>
